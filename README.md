Predictive Maintenance for Solar Farms

This project aims to predict inverter failures in solar farms using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data of various parameters such as temperature, voltage, current, and energy output, the model predicts potential failures, allowing for proactive maintenance, reducing downtime, and optimizing energy production.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Solar Power Generation Data** available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information on environmental factors, energy production, and failure history for a solar farm.

Project Overview
Goal: Predict inverter failures using environmental and performance data.
Key Features:
  - Temperature (`temp`)
  - Humidity (`humidity`)
  - Irradiance (`irradiance`)
  - Energy Output (`energy_output`)
Target: Failure (binary classification: 1 for failure, 0 for no failure)

Steps

1.Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values.
   - One-hot encode categorical features.
   - Scale the data to standardize numerical features.

2.Model:
   - Use a Random Forest Classifier for training and prediction.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - Evaluate the model using accuracy, classification report, and cross-validation.

3.Feature Importance:
   - Extract feature importance to understand which variables contribute most to the model's predictions.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
